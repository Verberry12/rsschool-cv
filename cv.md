## About Me

I have been involved in design and layout of publishing products for a long time. I received some of the skills for this work at the university, but most of them I learned on my own through practice. I worked in a small publishing house and created layouts of books, posters, and advertisements for my customers.

I have always strived to learn new things for myself. Therefore, a few years later, I began to look for ways to develop myself and tried to study a course in Python. This is how I started my journey in programming.

Now I am a student at School 21. This is a school for learning programming. During the process of studying here, I realized that I am interested in the direction of front-end development and this direction is related to my previous work experience, this makes it a little easier for me to study this topic now.

*I want to learn new cool skills and I am sure that I will succeed!*
